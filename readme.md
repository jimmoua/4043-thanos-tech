# Quick Start

Refer to the following guides below to quickly get acquainted with project workflow. It will include how to properly do PR's and such.

# SDLC Tools
Below are the tools that are going to be used to aide us in the SDLC.

## Team Communication Software
Just like COMS 4033, we will be using [Discord](https://www.discord.com/), since we should be most familiar with it.

## Source Control
For source control, We'll be using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and hosting the project on [GitHub](https://github.com).

## Software Methodology
We are going to use the agile scrum methodology. The agile software that we will be using is called [**Jira**](https://www.jira.com). In Jira, we can a backlog as well as the status of stories in a Kanban board. I have a Jira set up for our team already [here](https://thanostech.atlassian.net/).

We will be having scrum meetings **every week** on Thursday from 2:30pm - 3:50pm (CST), although this may be subject to change if there is a class meeting that day.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
We will let GitHub Actions handle our CI/CD.

We will be commiting code to the code repository. **We need to make sure that every time we make a push, our code is able to merge with the master branch and that all unit tests pass**. This helps with merge conflicts and making sure nothing breaks when pushing new code commits. For all PR's, GitHub Actions should do the following:

1. Builds the project for a specific branch
2. Runs unit tests to see if they pass
3. Deploy to the staging server (master)

If any of these steps fail, **the developer needs to go back and fix their code so that it may merge with master without any issues**.


# Project Details
> We'll be developing a web-based application that allows customers to create accounts and schedule appointments with selection of various styles or services. Weâ€™ll also allow people to reschedule. This will also allow the Owner to view all appointments and provide customer contact information.

1. A calender view that displays a list of free time slots in which users may schedule appointment.

# Tech Stack
Here is the basic stack we are using:

|   Name   |            Tech             |
| :------: | :-------------------------: |
| DynamoDB |          Database           |
| Express  |        Web framework        |
| ReactJs  |     Frontend framework      |
|  NodeJS  | Backend runtime environment |

We are orchestrating all of this mainly via AWS.
